I am a System & Software Engineer at [Qualcomm][Q] working on algorithm design, performance analysis and optimization for wireless communications.

Before joining Qualcomm, I got my PhD in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ucla.edu/) from [UCLA](http://http://www.ucla.edu/).
I got my master degree from [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) in Sweden.

## Things that I like
I am passionate about science and technology.
I love math, I enjoy coding and I am a big fan of classical music.
Doing these things makes me really happy.

### Math
I love math.
My favorite branch is mathematical analysis.
I am fascinated about topics in topological space, real analysis, probability, statistics and optimization.

### Coding
Coming from the [Matlab][M]/C background[^fn-matlab], I am really excited about [Julia][J]: a high-level dynamic language with C-ish performance.
I can quickly prototype a complicated algorithm and get very good performance.
I use [Julia][J] both in my research works and my teaching[^fn-julia].

### Music
I love classical music, from Baroque to Romantic.
My favorite composers are Bach, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Scriabin.
