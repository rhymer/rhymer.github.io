I am a System & Software Engineer at [Qualcomm][Q] working on algorithm design, performance analysis and optimization for wireless communications.

Before joining Qualcomm, I got my PhD in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ucla.edu/) from [UCLA](http://http://www.ucla.edu/).
I got my master degree from [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) in Sweden.

## Things that I like
I am passionate about science and technology.
I love math, I enjoy coding and I am a big fan of classical music.
Doing these things makes me really happy.

### Math
I love math.
My favorite branch is mathematical analysis.
I am fascinated about topics in topological space, real analysis, measure theory, and functional analysis.
I also like the more applied aspect of mathematics: probability, random process, statistics, numerical linear algebra and optimization.

### Coding
I have more than 8 years of experience in [Matlab][M] and C.
I was a lecturer of the [UCLA HSSEAS Matlab Workshop](http://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/student-opportunities/matlab).
You can download my slides and handout on my Github: [Matlab Graphics](https://github.com/rhymer/matlab-plot-tutorial).

Then I discovered [Julia][J], a high-level dynamic language with C-ish performance.
Coming from a [Matlab][M]/C background, I am really excited about [Julia][J]:
its syntax is clean, expressive and easy to understand.
I can quickly prototype a complicated algorithm and get very good performance.
I can also annotate the type of variables to help the compiler optimizing my code.

One downside of [Julia][J] is its [package ecosystem](http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html).
It is not as mature as [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python][P].
That's why I would suggest people who's interested in [Julia][J] should also play with [Python][P].

### Music
I love classical music, from Baroque to Romantic.
My favorite composers are Bach, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Scriabin.
