I came across an interesting anecdote about [Maria Jo√£o Pires][P]:
during a lunchtime concert in Amsterdam,
she realized that she rehearsed the wrong piano concerto when the music started.
I cannot imagine how horrifying it is!


Miraculously, she recovered from the shock and played the entire piece from memory; and she played it beautifully.
